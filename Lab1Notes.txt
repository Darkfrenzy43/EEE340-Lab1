Notes to remember:
- Only write the necessary test cases - don't need to have a very long list. These will be strictly marked.
- Parsers are written first and then the lexers second. We should write the lexer elements first though.
- Make grammar as simple as possible, but no simpler.
- Don't use a KEYWORDS element. Check out the tips instead.
- If internal structure of something will help out later, best move is to make it a parsing rule of lex elements
    ie. parsing rule : [TYPE][LITERAL];
- Try building the string out of fragments in a whole lexing rule


Next to do:

    Velaco is shit head: function call expression to while
    ! SKIP THE STRING LITERAL LEX !
