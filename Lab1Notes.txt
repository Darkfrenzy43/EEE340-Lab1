Notes to remember:
- Only write the necessary test cases - don't need to have a very long list. These will be strictly marked.
- Parsers are written first and then the lexers second. We should write the lexer elements first though.
- Make grammar as simple as possible, but no simpler.
- Don't use a KEYWORDS element. Check out the tips instead.
