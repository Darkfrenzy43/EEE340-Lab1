Notes to remember:
- Only write the necessary test cases - don't need to have a very long list. These will be strictly marked.
- Parsers are written first and then the lexers second. We should write the lexer elements first though.
- Make grammar as simple as possible, but no simpler.
- Don't use a KEYWORDS element. Check out the tips instead.
- If internal structure of something will help out later, best move is to make it a parsing rule of lex elements
    ie. parsing rule : [TYPE][LITERAL];
- Try building the string out of fragments in a whole lexing rule


Next to do:
    Brown is fucking hot : Bottom to if-else
    Velaco is shit head: function call expression to while
    ! SKIP THE STRING LITERAL LEX !


Completed Items:

    Lexical Elements:
        - Whitespace
        - Comments
        - Types Names
        - Identifiers
        - Operators (already in expressions)

        - Literals:
            - true and false
            - integers

        - to do in Literals:
            1. String literals

    - To do in Lexical Elements:
        1. proper implementation of keywords


    Expressions:

        Are literals, identifiers, unary and binary operator expressions, parenthesized expressions,
        and function calls.

        - Literal expressions: integer string and bool expressions
        - Identifier expressions
        - Unary operator expressions
        - Binary operator expressions (defined implicitly)
        - parenthesized expressions

    To do in Expressions:

        - Function call expression
            - includes parameter list


    Variable Declarations:

        - literally the variable declaration


    Statements:

        - assignment
        - print

    To do/verify:

        - while loop
        - if else statement
        - return statement
        - function statement (one on its own)


    To do in Function definitions:
        - the function definition
        - the parameter declaration


    Program structure:

        - function definition block (as many needed)
        - main block (one is needed)
